This repository aims to present practices using ```tensorflow / keras``` framework for deep learning models. In addition to a well-commented implementation, each notebook contains a theoretical explanation about each model, functioning as a brief introduction to this content.

**PS**: The portuguese version of this repo, can be found [here](https://github.com/KaikeWesleyReis/praticas-deep-learning).
