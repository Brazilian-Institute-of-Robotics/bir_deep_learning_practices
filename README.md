This repository aims to present practices using ```tensorflow / keras``` framework for deep learning models. In addition to a well-commented implementation, each *notebook* contains a theoretical explanation about each model, functioning as as a brief introduction to this content.

## **Developed Models/Concepts**
- :heavy_check_mark: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
- :heavy_check_mark: Recurrent Neural Networks - LSTM & GRU (RNN)
- :heavy_check_mark: Semantic Segmentation
- :soon: Instance Segmentation
- :soon: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

**PS**: The portuguese version of this repo, can be found [here](https://github.com/KaikeWesleyReis/praticas-deep-learning).
