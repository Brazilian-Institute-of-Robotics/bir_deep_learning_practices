# Recurrent Neural Networks for Time series regression with Transfer Learning

The **goal** here is to present a theoretical/practical knowledge about RNN models such as:
- LSTM (*Long-Short Term Memory*)
- GRU (*Gated Recurrent Unit*)

Besides that, I explain about *Transfer Learning*.

The *notebook* uses ```keras``` in ```tensorflow 2.0```
